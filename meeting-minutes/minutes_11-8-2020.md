# Meeting Minutes 11/8/2020
## Topic: Storyboarding For DL Elegantly 
Participants: Keshava, Siva, Aditya
## Proposal
The approach is to have Aditya and other students narrate the content. We will have 3 minion-like characters.
They will visible from behind, like they're sitting in a movie theater. They'll be sitting
in a couch, thinking and talking, with speech/thought bubbles popping audibly.

Proposed Minions: Dr. Kalam Minion, Rajni Minion, Subraminion, Brahmi, Vadivelu, Keshto, Utpal, etc.

Proposed Alternates: Characters like Simpu Singh, Malgudi days, Panchatantra, Tenali Raman, Akbar and Birbal
Newspaper comic strip characters, Mullapudi Ramana and Bapu, etc.

Aditya to come back with alternate ideas for storyboarding

## Plan Going Forward
Review current written content, starting with Chapter 0, and storyboard based on these ideas.
Plan for today is to conceptualize the first five pages (if possible) of Chapter 0.

Need to consult lawyer for license, currently picked Apache 2.0 based on limited knowledge of licensing.
