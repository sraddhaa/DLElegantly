PARA 1

The story of deep learning, as viewed by the general public, 
is a recent phenomenon. 
In reality it’s actually a long and old story rooted in humankind’s
fascination with understanding reasoning,
where reasoning occurred, the processes associated with it, 
their interconnections, and if and how reasoning can be recreated.

SUGGESTED IMAGE: 1 For timeline, showing recent deep learning interest
                 2 For reasoning, show visual representation of act of 
reasoining
Minion Interjection: I guess this has nothing to do with YOU, then.
                     How do amoeba think? Are YOU an amoeba? You don't 
have a brain.
                     Hey man, I don't need to learn all this. Just 
shallow will do. I'm friends with Dory.


PARA 2

Though it is now common knowledge that 
a.	Thinking occurs in the brain
b.	Our brains have billions of interconnected neurons
 or brain cells 
c.	These brain cells or neurons work collectively as a connected
 “intelligence” network to enable us to think, to feel, and, 
 to act
this common knowledge is actually the result of millennia of 
“not so common” research and investigation – 
research that has been punctuated by short, intense bursts of
 progress and long, debilitating periods of regress. 

SUGGESTED IMAGE for Process of thinking: Ant Colony or Beehive 
cross-section or Banyan Vines 
                    fading to Neuron Network (Brain)
SUGGESTED IMAGE for Progress/Regress: Tracing the progress of specific 
point on a wheel
                 Shunting Engines
                 Trucks stuck in mud spinning their wheels
Minion Interjection Process of Thinking: I thought the brain was in your 
gut? 
                        I've only seen you think with your stomach.
                        I'm hungry now.
Minion Interjection Progress/Regress: I guess your brain hasn't evolved 
just yet.

PARA 3
Historical evidence shows that the brain has been a constant object
 of study from antiquity. 
Scientists from ancient times, across several civilizations, 
studied the brain to comprehend its functions and used that 
knowledge for medical purposes 

SUGGESTED IMAGES: images of Charaka, Sushruta,
                     trepanation in Harappa:
                      https://bit.ly/38tt9L5; 
                      Babylonian, Egyptian efforts). 

Minion Interjection: Surgery Anyone? (with hammer and chisel and doctor 
outfit)

PARA 4
In the early Common Era (C.E.), scientists and researchers who 
shared this fascination with the workings of the brain continued 
their efforts, and by the first century, a general physical 
description of the brain was available to the scientific community. 
Basic structures such as the soft and hard layers encasing the 
brain were identified, and the brain was divided into functional
regions, known as ventricles.

SUGGESTED IMAGES: Train moving forward slowly, labeled progress
                  Skull as hard layer, brain as soft inner portion
                  Need a time-period appropriate image
Minion Interjection: I thought ventricles only in the heart.
                     That drawing looks like an advanced version of your 
brain.


PARA 5
Building upon this work, over the next few centuries,
physicians concluded that mental activity occurred in 
the brain rather than the heart, thus concurring with what
some pre-common era scientists had already suggested.  
What seems like a small step today was actually a huge step
forward for that time. Some scientists also concluded that 
the brain was the seat of a soul. 
They believed that this was one of three souls found in the body,
each associated with a principal organ.  
There were even some scientists who were of the opinion that 
the brain was a cold, moist organ formed of sperm! 

SUGGESTED IMAGES: GIF of brain moving from the heart to the head through
                    the throat
                  One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind

Minion Interjection: You ARE a cold moist organ. 
                     Your brain's not even big enough for you, 
                        and they thought you had space for two more?
                     So like a palm fruit?

PARA 6
By the Middle Ages, however, the anatomy of the brain was broadly 
believed to be consolidated around three principal divisions.  
Each division localized the site of a different mental activity. 
Imagination was believed to be located in the anterior ventricle
and memory in the posterior ventricle, with reason in between. 
At the time, inputs received from the five senses were known as 
common sense. 
Yet it seems like that was all that scientists of the time 
could really agree on. 
There was no consensus on where the storing and processing of 
common sense occurred. 
Eleventh century scientists proposed common sense was housed 
in a "faculty of fantasy," one that received 
"all the forms which are imprinted on the five senses."
Memory then preserved what common sense received.  

SUGGESTED IMAGES: Scientist Minions fighting with speech bubbles about 
the brain's
                    anatomy. They're carrying cudgels/swords/etc.

FADE TO BLACK: "A moment of silence in respect for all scientists,
 all over the world, who have made sacrifices in the pursuit of 
science."
